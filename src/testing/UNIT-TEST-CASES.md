pass:
* contactDetails dialog: need to test out the delete/removeFromLabel methods by hitting them manually
* working on contactsService methods
* make a comparison of unit to e2e at this point.


### more actions
no functionality for this in contactListItem, BUT... have functionality in it for contactDetail as it needs to close detail dialog if:
remove from label
delete contact

So.. just wrapping more actions isn't enough. So... need to test these two in the dialog, anyway you can, just call manually? I suppose, call manually, then verify they do what they say.

## dialogs
### contact detail
* should show all data
* should call correct method/services for edit/moreactions/close buttons
